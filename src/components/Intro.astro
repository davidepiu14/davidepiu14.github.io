    <p class="mb-5">Hi there! I'm Davide Piu, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹</p>
    <p class="text-center whitespace-nowrap overflow-auto">
      My primary interest lies in software engineering, while I'm on the brink
      of completing a Master's degree in Data Science and Business Analytics.
      Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at <a
        href="https://www.banksealer.com">Banksealer</a
      >. In my current role, my focus is primarily on enhancing our backend and
      I'm deeply involved in elevating our Development Experience (DevEx),
      improving our CI/CD, and refining the monitoring of our infrastructure.
      Our current tech stack is: Scala (backend), TS w React (Frontend),
      Kubernetes, Tekton, Kafka, MySQL, Grafana, Prometheus, Groundcover. Feel
